						BSAE-3B GUI Instructions			
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In the current directory, open the MAIN.m file (NOT the MAIN.fig). ***PLEASE NOTE: No other matlab function file 
   can be run on its own. Therefore, if you try to run any .m file, other than MAIN.m, an error will occur since
   each function expects parameters (inputs) when called.*** 

2. Before pressing RUN, right-click on the opened file in the editor and click "Change current folder to ...".

3. Now we are ready to run the GUI! In the editor tab, click Run and the GUI will pop-up on the screen.

4. Choose all desired input parameters, then click the green button titled "Generate Design!".

5. There will be a message box that appears on the screen to let you know that the parametrization is in progress. 
   Once complete, a second message box will appear to inform you that the design was successfully optimized.
   On the right-hand side of the GUI, the Log Output panel will be populated with the Log text file found at:  
   'Z:\2018\MCG4322A\Digital Files\BSAE-3B\Log\BSAE-3B_LOG.txt'.

6. The SolidWorks is now ready to be re-built! Navigate to 'Z:\2018\MCG4322A\Digital Files\BSAE-3B' and open the
   TOP LEVEL ASSEMBLY SolidWorks Assembly file. Once opened, press re-build and wait for the SolidWorks to update to
   the Optimized dimensions. Many of the changes are internal, such as tube thickness of the frame and suspension,
   and will require cross-section views to notice the changes. ***PLEASE NOTE: If there are warnings or errors when
   the assembly opens, please re-build again.

7. Enjoy playing with the suspension and steering!

We hope you enjoyed our GUI and Parametrization! If you have any questions or concerns, please contact any member from the BSAE-3B Team
