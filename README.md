# BajaSAEParametrization

BajaSAEParametrization is a mechanical engineering capstone project completed at the University of Ottawa. The purpose of this project was to design and analyze a fully parametrizable BAJA SAE off-road vehicle. I created a user-friendly MATLAB GUI to automate the parametrization process.
